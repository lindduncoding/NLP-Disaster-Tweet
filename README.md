# NLP-Disaster-Tweet
This is a public repository of our NLP notebook regarding the Disaster Tweet dataset, originally made in February 2024 as the final project of TETI AI Bootcamp 2024.

Are you **tired** of looking at Twitter's trending page to see what's going on just to see a bunch of unrelated tweets hijacking the trending keyword to be on top? Me too! But worry no more, with the help of our tool, this problem can be avoided.

Our machine learning tool uses NLP to process a bunch of tweets and then uses binary classification to determine if a tweet is related to something or not, in our case it's disaster. Sometimes, tweets include words that are mainly used to describe a disaster: ablaze, earthquake, burning. But just because a tweet has those words in it, doesn't mean the **context** of the tweet is about disaster. Just like our previous problem, where a tweet is "hijacking" the trending keywords to get on top of the trending page even though the tweet itself doesn't really talk about the trending topic. 

We hope that our model can help disaster mitigation by quickly scanning through the trending page of twitter to see the most recent and accurate coverage of a disaster. However there are rooms for improvements. In the future, this project can be trained on Indonesian tweets (to better help local disaster mitigation), and maybe use a better model (deep learning?) to help with the accuracy. 

Thank you and we hope you find this insightful!
